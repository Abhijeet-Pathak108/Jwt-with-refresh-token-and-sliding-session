## Import both branch frontend and backend seperately

### Credentials

username = abhi
<br>
password = 1234

### Database contains only one table to store refresh token and for user credentials no db is used as only one user is listed and his credentials are mentioned above.
#### if want to use multiple user then you need to create register endpoint and extra table in db and fetch credentials from db


## To run the project smoothly try to run frontend on localhost instead of 127.0.0.1 like localhost:port_no
